# Fixing 404 Errors

## The Problem

You're seeing: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()`

This happens because the assets are referenced with `/garmfiles/assets/...` but the server isn't serving them correctly.

## Solutions

### If Testing Locally

**Option 1: Use the test server (Recommended)**
```bash
# Build first
npm run build:gh-pages

# Start test server
npm run test:gh-pages
# Then visit: http://localhost:8080/garmfiles/
```

**Option 2: Use vite preview (but access at correct path)**
```bash
npm run build:gh-pages
npm run preview:dist
# Then visit: http://localhost:4173/garmfiles/
# Note: You MUST include /garmfiles/ in the URL!
```

### If on GitHub Pages

1. **Check the URL:**
   - ✅ Correct: `https://sfoubusgit.github.io/garmfiles/`
   - ❌ Wrong: `https://sfoubusgit.github.io/` (will show 404)

2. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for which file is 404:
     - `/garmfiles/assets/index-XXXXX.js` = JavaScript
     - `/garmfiles/assets/index-XXXXX.css` = CSS

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/sfoubusgit/garmfiles/actions
   - Check if the workflow completed successfully
   - If it failed, check the error message

4. **Check GitHub Pages Settings:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/sfoubusgit/garmfiles/settings/pages
   - Source should be: **GitHub Actions** (not a branch)

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Testing at Wrong URL
**Problem:** Visiting `http://localhost:4173/` instead of `http://localhost:4173/garmfiles/`

**Solution:** Always include `/garmfiles/` at the end of the URL

### Issue 2: Assets Not Deployed
**Problem:** The `dist/assets/` folder isn't being deployed

**Solution:** 
1. Check Actions tab → See if build succeeded
2. Verify `dist/assets/` folder exists locally after build
3. Re-deploy by pushing a new commit

### Issue 3: Base Path Mismatch
**Problem:** Base path in code doesn't match repository name

**Solution:** Already set to `/garmfiles/` which matches your repo ✓

## Quick Diagnostic

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:gh-pages
   ```

2. **Check dist folder:**
   ```bash
   ls dist/assets/
   ```
   Should see: `index-XXXXX.js` and `index-XXXXX.css`

3. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:gh-pages
   ```
   Visit: `http://localhost:8080/garmfiles/`

4. **If local test works but GitHub Pages doesn't:**
   - Check GitHub Actions workflow
   - Verify Pages settings use "GitHub Actions"
   - Wait a few minutes for deployment to complete

## Still Not Working?

Check the browser console (F12) and tell me:
1. Which exact file is showing 404?
2. What's the full URL it's trying to load?
3. Are you testing locally or on GitHub Pages?
